# Mock Interview Questions
Behavioral Interview

1. # Talk about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.

    Gladly. Recently, when I was working in a team enviroment to help selling health insurance.  The Teamleader was training me and another person.  Each time we get someone to give us their name and phone number, the team leader would take the information from us.  We were under the impression he was going to let us know what happen with the client.  He never said anything.  It force me to ask him what does he do with leads that supposed to be ours and took it from us but never share the commission of the sales with us.  It was hard to know if he closed or not because he said he never closed them.  As a result, next time we got a lead, we kept it for ourselves.

    2. # Give me an example of a time you faced a conflict while working on a team. How did you handle that?

            Working in team always bring the best or worst on people.  In team enviroment, it helps you to see who are the leaders by leading with example and who are those fighting to be in charge of group project.  I have worked with people who always wants to throw their weight around as the ones to be charge but never really know how to lead a group of people.  I was working on a group project selling life insurance and one of the team members was being disrespectful to customers as they were passing by and they did not want to stop at our table.  I had to tell him, your approach is not effective.  You can't force the customer to stop on our table if they don't want to.  We went back and forth for a minute and then he calmed down. We both agree that we need to show respect to the customers because we do not know who they know.  For the rest of the day, we had a peaceful time bringing customers to our table.

3. # Describe a time when you struggled to build a relationship with someone important. How did you eventually overcome that?

    Building relationship with people is always a fun venture for me.  I did have a coworker one time, who was a bit challenging to be my work friend.  Best way I dealt with it was just leaving her alone until she could come around.  The problem was, I was helping customers and she felt some kind of way that people were asking for me instead of letting her helping them.  Whenever she couldn't help customers, I did step offer to help her so she can help the customer.  Eventually we became work friends.

4. # We all make mistakes we wish we could take back. Tell me about a time you wish you’d handled a situation differently with a colleague.

    You could say that again.  Sometimes we work with people and they say something to you and you say something back, it can cause the environment to be unbearable.  Let me share with you when I became the customer service manager at a supermarket over the people who was there before me.  They did not want to listen to me when I tell them to open up to help the customers, when I told them to take out the trash when it was full.  This young lady was being very disresful, I had to tell her to go home and had a meeting with the store manager where she got terminated. Thinking about it today, I really feel bad because she had a child to care for and I had to get her terminated over a disagreement that could have been handled differently.

5. # Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?
    Well, as an Insurance Agent, it is my business to know my customers business.  Like how much savings they have, their 401(k) and other personal information.  This particular customer was not confortable sharing her data.  I tried to explained to her the information will help me know how much insurance she needs and it will also guide which kind I will be able to recommend. Sometimes it is not what the person is saying but what they are not saying.  Each time I would ask the question, she became tense and guide me with her eyes because her husband was there.  When I got the message as if she was not comfortable telling her business in front of her husband, I quickly switch gear and said allow me to go over what we have so far and will see the best solution that will fit the situation at hand.  I will call you to make another appointment.  Later on that day, I called and ask her the information over the phone.  Sure enought she confessed that she did not want to share her information in the presence of her husband but shared everything with me over the phone.

6. # Describe a time when it was especially important to make a good impression on a client. How did you go about doing so?
    I do not believe I have experience this in my careers.  It would be very interesting to know what I could possibly do to impress an important client.  I may have seen on televisions where they book a dinner date in a fancy expensive restaurant or get a reservation in a restaurant that was already over booked.  

7. # Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectations. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
    Going back to the supermaket, a customer who finished drinking almost half of the galon of milk she purchased.  The date now has expired and she return it saying the milk smell bad.  I said yes because the date has passed.  She said she wants another one.  I said No you cannot get another one because the date expired.  We went back and forth for a while and when I realized it was a senior citizen and it probably will never reach her understanding of what it is she is doing - return an item she already used to its expiration date.  I agree to give her a half a galon milk instead of a whole galon.  Was pleased with the outcome and she came back next day to shop again and look for me to say hello.

8. # Tell me about a time when you made sure a customer was pleased with your service.
    Since the incident with the customer about the milk, it has become my focus that customers are important to any business.  It is my job to always find a solution that will help them leave happy.  I wanted to be adament about the milk she returned but to keep the customer happy, I gave her a half gallon instead of a whole gallon.  She was pleased.

9. # Describe a time when you had to interact with a difficult client. What was the situation, and how did you handle it?

    Dealing with difficult client is what helps me to grow.  We will never be able to satisfy all customers 100% of the time so when we do find the difficult ones, we have to do our best to put ourselves in their shoes.  I was working for CUNY as a PC Technician.  I just came from working as a helpdesk support associate and moved to the PC Tech Department.  First week, we are rolling out Outlook in every staff computers.  I was fortunate to be the one to do get the VP's secretary pc and the installation did not go according to plan.  The Tech supervisor had a meeting on a day I was not there and they changed the way the rollout was supposed to happened.  The day I returned, I was not told any new information so I did it the old way.  When she tried to access her email the next day, It did not worked.  Almost everyone in my department heard it and it was very difficult to resolve it when someone kept screaming on how important her job was and she could work without her email.  the solution was, I quickly got her a computer that had all her files, a working email and made the switch between her old computer and the new computer.  It took sometime to calm her down but I kept my composure because going back and forth with her, would only make things worst.  I was wrong.

10. # When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?
    I believe understanding what or who is important plays an importan role in delivering good customer service.  While working in CUNY, we had staff, students and faculty who needs our help with their technical problems.  At the same token, we have phone calls coming in asking to reset password to email, computers, etc.  So it was easy to prioritized the faculties because they need thier info to teach the class.  Follow by the staff because their job is as important and then the students.  They need theirs because they want to access wireless access and their email which is not critically important because it is first day.  They have the option to come after class or next day but my job is to assist as many and as fast as posslible.  First of day of school you can imagine the chaos of dealing with all three branches of the school on day 1 to day 100?

11. # Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it?

    The good thing about being under a lot of pressure is not to let othes know you are under a lot of pressure.  Being under a lot presure is a sign of not knowing how to prioritized.  I worked as the IT Manager for a real estate firm in Manhattan.  The department had one person in charge of the IT Department and had many offices in the city.  I would feel the most pressure when one office closed and every technology equipment have to be out like 2 days before or the day before they place is turn over to the owner and the agents in the offices still need my help with their technical problems.  That is when I knew what pressure was like.  I got through it by using the skills of the office managers in each office location while I focuse in discomissioned the office and pack everything out of there.  There were days I would stay in office past midnigth to make sure the job was done according to its deadline.

12. # Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?
    While working for the Real Estate firm, I have learned to adapt to all the empromptu changes.  Everything could be calm today and tomorrow a million things went bad.  There was a time when I slept in my office trying to solve an internet issue.  We used a firewall called Barracuda and for some reason after discommission an office in the same building, our internet was not working for the other offices.  I spent hours working with vendor support trying to fix it.  They even got their top level support members from Germany involve in the problem.  None was able to resolve it.  sometime at 1am, we finally discover the contruction that was going on next door may have cut our internet line outside of our office space.  So, to resolved that, I had to get a team to come to run long connection CAT6 cables from the floor that I just dicommissioned to the floor that is not working so we can get internet service there until I can bring the ISP provider to give us new line connections.

13. # Tell me about the first job you’ve ever had. What did you do to learn the ropes?

    First job I ever had was working in the supermaket and I had to learn cash register.  Taking customers money and give them the right change was nurve racking at the time because customers could be mean and you might make a mistake in giving one customer too much money or too little money. Either one was bad according to the company rules.  To learn the ropes, I first had to go to cashier training where we had mock cashier training and fake items to scan.  Next we get to work with real customers and test it out.  Final stage in our training was to go to our stores and work alone as a cashier.  My tactic was to move as fast as could with scanning and take my time double checking the money I was taking from the customer and the change I was returning to the customer.

14. # Give me an example of a time when you had to think on your feet in order to delicately extricate yourself from a difficult or awkward situation.

        Return back to the situation with the VP secretary's, she was being very disrespecful at the time and best way to excuse myself was to explain to her, the best way for me to resolve this at the present moment is to go work on a computer and come and replace this one for you as fast I as possibly can.  My apologies for the inconvenience but allow me to get started on that for you.  It made a difference on my approache because she was calmed.

15. # Tell me about a time you failed. How did you deal with the situation?

    We all failed sometimes in life.  The best example I can give you is when I was in college and I did not passed math class during my fresh year and I had to take it over.  The best way I was able to make sure that I passed was to get go for tutoring asap and it help to resolved the matter fast.  So when I went for Bachlors Degree, I made sure I got a tutor early and that helped to pass calculus without any difficulty.

16. # Tell me about a time you had to be very strategic in order to meet all your top priorities.

17. # Describe a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?
